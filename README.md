# WA Airbnb Performance Analysis
This repo shows a set of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the process of estimating the performance of airbnb listings in Western Australia, and then analyzing the results to assess what variables are likely to play the greatest role in determining a listing's performance. The data sets were obtained from the Insideairbnb data set collection, and 3 data sets were used with quarterly collection dates 25/6/2023, 21/9/2023, and 23/12/2023. The latest data set contains 12521 listings, with 75 features columns for each listing. These features include information such as price, number of bedrooms, latitude and longitude coordinates, and reviews per month.
