# WA Airbnb Performance Analysis
In this project I tackled the objective of calculating the performance (defined as estimated monthly income) of airbnb listings in Western Australia for the purpose of analyzing and visualizing the factors that determine a listing's performance. To achieve this, extensive cleaning and transformations of features was required to produce accurate estimates.

## Dataset 
The data sets were obtained from the [Inside airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/) data set collection, and 3 data sets were used with quarterly collection dates 25/6/2023, 21/9/2023, and 23/12/2023. The latest data set contains 12521 listings, with 75 features for each listing. A full list of feature definitons can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWCNJcSutYqpULSQHlNyGInUvHg2BoUGoNRIGa6Szc4/edit#gid=1322284596)

## The Approach
The data includes information regarding three key variables:
1. The price of a listing (per night)
2. The number of reviews a listing recieves per month
3. The minimum number of nights a listing can be booked for

Through cleaning and transformations, these variables will allow us to approximate the income i.e. performance of a listing.


## Outcome
[A summary of the final results can be found in a presentation here.](AirbnbPresentation.pdf)

Despite the limitations of the data, we were able to produce relatively accurate performance estimates. From here, we were able to assess which factors played the biggest roles in the performance of a listing, and better understand the reasons behind a listing's success. This information can then be considered when deciding whether to purchase a property with the intention of utilizing it as an Airbnb.










For future
figure out if the price of a listing is considered 'fair'
  use surrounding listings
  compare its price to its bedrooms/amenities etc
