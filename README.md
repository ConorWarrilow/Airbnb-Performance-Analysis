# WA Airbnb Performance Analysis
This repo shows a set of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the process of estimating the performance of airbnb listings in Western Australia, and then analyzing the results to assess what variables are likely to play the greatest role in determining a listing's performance. The data sets were obtained from the Insideairbnb data set collection, and 3 data sets were used with quarterly collection dates 25/6/2023, 21/9/2023, and 23/12/2023. The latest data set contains 12521 listings, with 75 features columns for each listing. These features include information such as price, number of bedrooms, latitude and longitude coordinates, and reviews per month.

## The Aim
The overall aim of the project is to answer the question: 'what factors determine the success of an airbnb?'


## The Approach

The data provided includes information regarding three key variables: The price of a listing, the number of reviews a listing recieves per month, and the minimum number of nights a listing can be booked for. Through cleaning the data and using various transformations, these variables will allow us to approximate the income of a listing.



## The result










For future
figure out if the price of a listing is considered 'fair'
  use surrounding listings
  compare its price to its bedrooms/amenities etc
