# WA Airbnb Performance Analysis
This repo shows a set of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the process of estimating the performance of airbnb listings in Western Australia, and then analyzing the results to assess what variables are likely to play the greatest role in determining a listing's performance. The data sets were obtained from the Insideairbnb data set collection, and 3 data sets were used with quarterly collection dates 25/6/2023, 21/9/2023, and 23/12/2023. The latest data set contains 12521 listings, with 75 features columns for each listing. These features include information such as price, number of bedrooms, latitude and longitude coordinates, and reviews per month.

It is a dataset of Zalando's article images â€” consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The dataset serves as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
